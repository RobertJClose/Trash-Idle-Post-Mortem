# Trash Idle - Playtesting The Cauchy
With the game submitted, I sent it to a few friends for them to try and make sense of. Most of them knew nothing about the game going into the experience, and a few of the playtests were live on a call. I was pleasantly surprised! 

I didn't really get to implement any of the classic idle-game features, and the usual structure of progression is missing as well. People weren't aware of what was planned or intended however, and they were quite curious about what was going on. Several people were able to convince themselves that what they typed influenced how much money they got, as well as which currency they would be rewarded in. 

It was a little embarrassing to then reveal that many of those features were planned, but were not implemented. However for me it was really entertaining to see people look for meaning in what was actually a random experience. People also enjoyed the interactive component of mashing away at their keyboards as well. 

Despite its stripped-back nature I am quite proud of the experience.
